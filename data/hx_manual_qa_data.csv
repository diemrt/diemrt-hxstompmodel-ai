Question;Answer
What is a “block” in the context of the HX Stomp?;A block is a processing unit that represents an element of your tone such as an amp, cab, effect, looper, input, output, or impulse response. The HX Stomp can host up to six blocks simultaneously, allowing for complex signal chains.
What constitutes a “preset” on the HX Stomp?;A preset is your complete tone configuration. It comprises all the blocks, snapshots, and any associated footswitch or controller assignments, enabling you to recall a full sound setup with one selection.
How many presets does the HX Stomp store, and how are they organized?;The HX Stomp stores 42 banks with three presets per bank (A, B, and C), resulting in a total of 126 presets that you can navigate via Play view.
What is the difference between Play view and Edit view?;Play view is optimized for live performance, allowing quick switching between presets and snapshot functions using footswitches and knobs. Edit view is used for creating or tweaking tones with detailed control over individual block parameters and the overall signal path.
How do you switch between Play view and Edit view?;You switch views by pressing the VIEW button. In Play view, you access preset banks and footswitch assignments; in Edit view, you see the block layout and parameter details.
How do you quickly bypass a block or the entire HX Stomp?;To bypass an individual block, select it and press its assigned button, making the icon semi‐transparent. To completely bypass the unit, press the Upper and Lower Knobs together, which displays an Analog [or DSP] bypass message.
What are the two types of bypass available on the HX Stomp?;The HX Stomp offers analog (true) bypass, which mechanically routes the signal directly from input to output, and DSP bypass, which allows delay echoes and reverb tails to decay naturally even when the effect is off.
Describe the 4-Cable Method with HX Stomp.;The 4-Cable Method routes the HX Stomp signal into an amp’s effects loop. One block (Send/Return) is inserted in the signal path before the amp’s preamp or effects, enabling you to blend a processed signal with a direct amp tone, especially useful when using an amp’s FX loop.
What is parallel routing, and how does it differ from serial routing?;In serial routing, your entire signal passes through one continuous chain of blocks. In parallel routing, the signal is split into two stereo paths (Path A and Path B), processed separately, and then merged, allowing you to run two distinct effects chains and blend them together.
How do you move or copy/paste blocks within a preset?;In Edit view, select a block by turning the Upper Knob and pressing ACTION. To move it, pick it up using the action panel and choose its new location. To copy and paste, pick the block, press the copy command, select the destination, and then press paste. Always save your changes afterward.
What are snapshots, and how do they work?;Snapshots are variations of a preset that allow you to quickly recall different parameter settings without changing the overall block structure. They are switched via footswitches and let you modify your tone on the fly for different song sections or effect intensities.
How can you update the firmware on the HX Stomp?;Firmware updates are done using the Line 6 Updater tool. Connect the HX Stomp to your computer via USB, launch the updater (and install the USB driver on Windows if needed), log into your Line 6 account, and follow the on-screen instructions.
What functions do the main knobs and buttons on the HX Stomp perform?;The Upper Knob is used for selecting presets or blocks, the Lower Knob changes models or edits parameters, and additional knobs adjust specific settings. The VIEW button toggles between main screens, while the ACTION button opens context-specific menus.
How do you assign an external controller, such as an expression pedal, to a parameter?;In Edit view, press and hold the parameter’s knob to jump to the Controller Assign page. Then follow the on-screen instructions to map an external controller (like an expression pedal or MIDI controller) to that parameter.
What is the purpose of the Input block, and what settings can you adjust there?;The Input block processes the signal before it is routed to other blocks. It includes a noise gate with adjustable threshold and decay settings, and allows you to choose the input source (Main or Return). Its impedance setting also affects the tone and feel of your instrument’s pickups.
What does the Output block do and what parameters can you control?;The Output block manages the final signal level and panning before the signal exits the HX Stomp. It includes controls for overall level, balance (pan), and in some cases, the type of output (mono or stereo Send/Return) when using a Mixer block.
How is the Amp+Cab block different from separate Amp or Cab blocks?;The Amp+Cab block conveniently combines an amp model with a matching cab or IR model, automatically loading the cab when you select the amp model. This integration saves one block in your signal chain and simplifies tone creation.
How do you change between different models (such as amp, cab, or effect models) within a block?;In Edit view, select the block you want to change and use the Lower Knob to open the model list. Then navigate through the available categories and subcategories until you find and select the desired model.
What role does Dynamic DSP play in the HX Stomp?;Dynamic DSP manages the processing power within the HX Stomp. Since some blocks use more DSP than others, Dynamic DSP ensures that if a preset is DSP-heavy, you might be limited in the number or type of models you can use simultaneously, and it dynamically allocates resources.
How can you set or adjust tap tempo and tuner functions?;Tap tempo is accessed using the TAP/TUNER switch (or FS3) in Play or Scroll mode, where you tap the footswitch to set the BPM. Holding the switch brings up the tuner screen to check string tuning and adjust settings like reference frequency and string offsets.
What connectivity options does the HX Stomp provide?;The HX Stomp offers multiple connectivity options including stereo inputs (L/MONO and RIGHT), outputs (L/MONO and RIGHT), a USB interface for audio and MIDI, a headphone output, MIDI In/Out/Thru ports, and Send/Return jacks for effects loop applications.
How does the USB audio interface function on the HX Stomp?;The HX Stomp acts as a high-quality multichannel USB audio interface (24-bit/96kHz), allowing you to record directly into a DAW, use DI recording, and even re-amp tracks. It supports both Mac and Windows platforms with the appropriate drivers.
What are some common parameters found across many effects models in the HX Stomp?;Common parameters include Drive (overdrive/distortion), Bass, Mid, Treble, Speed/Rate (modulation speed), Time (delay/repeat time), Depth (modulation intensity), Feedbk (feedback), Mix (blend of dry and wet signals), and Level (overall output level).
How do footswitches enhance live performance with the HX Stomp?;Footswitches are assigned to functions like preset recall, block toggling, snapshot switching, and tap tempo/tuner operations, enabling hands-free control during a live performance.
How is MIDI integrated with the HX Stomp?;The HX Stomp supports MIDI by sending and receiving program changes, continuous controllers, and parameter adjustments. This allows for remote control, preset/snapshot recall via MIDI, and synchronization with other MIDI-capable devices.
