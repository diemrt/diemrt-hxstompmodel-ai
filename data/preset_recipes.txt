AMBIENT SOUND RECIPE
To create an ambient sound, start with a reverb (Hall or Room) with long decay (70-90%) and moderate pre-delay (30-40%). Add a delay after the reverb, preferably the Dual Delay, with different time settings (try 400ms and 600ms) and moderate feedback (40-50%). Keep the mix levels balanced (30-40% each).

WARM DELAY SETTINGS
For a warm delay tone using the Simple Delay, set the Tone control lower (around 30-40%) to reduce high frequencies. Keep the feedback moderate (40-50%) for natural decay. The mix should be around 35% for subtle presence. Time can be set to match your tempo - try 350ms for ambient textures.

ETHEREAL SOUNDSCAPE
Layer Room Reverb (Size: 75%, Decay: 85%, Mix: 45%) with Multitap Delay (3 heads, spread wide, moderate feedback). Add subtle pitch shifting (+5 semitones) with low mix (20%) for crystalline overtones.

RHYTHMIC DELAY PATTERNS
Use Dual Delay for rhythmic patterns. Set Time A to quarter notes and Time B to dotted eighths. Keep Feedback A at 35% and Feedback B at 45% for interesting polyrhythms. Overall mix around 40%.

BASIC AMBIENT PAD
Start with Hall Reverb (Decay: 85%, Pre-Delay: 15%, Mix: 60%, Lo Cut: 100Hz, Hi Cut: 8kHz). Follow with Analog Delay (Time: 800ms, Feedback: 45%, Mix: 30%, Wow/Flutter: 25%) for movement.
