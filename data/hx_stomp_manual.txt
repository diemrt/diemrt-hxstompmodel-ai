Welcome to HX Stomp

Common Terminology
While reading this manual, you may encounter several unfamiliar terms. It’s important
to know what they mean. Be careful—we might toss a pop quiz your way.

"50 pages for a pedal? Man, I hate reading manuals!"

Block Blocks are objects that represent various elements of your tone, such
as amps, cabs, effects, splits, loopers, inputs, outputs, and impulse
responses. The HX Stomp pedal can accommodate up to six simultaneous amp, cab, IR, effects, and/or looper blocks, DSP permitting.

I know, right?! We're not overly fond of writing them either, especially when so few
people read them. What if we make a handful of super-short videos that get you up
and running with HX Stomp in minutes, and you promise to not jump online and complain about having to read a 50-page manual for a pedal. Agreed?
Go here line6.com/meet-hx-stomp:

Model Each processing block can accommodate one model (or in some

cases, two models). HX Stomp includes over 77 guitar and bass amp
models, 37 cab models, 16 mic models, and 200 effects models.

Preset A preset is your tone. It consists of all blocks, snapshots, footswitch
assignments, and controller assignments.

Controller Controllers are used to adjust various parameters in real time. For ex-

ample, an external expression pedal can be used to control wah, or
the mod wheel on your MIDI keyboard can be used to control delay
feedback and reverb depth.

Send/ The HX Stomp stereo TRS Send and separate left and right Returns are
Return used to insert your favorite stompboxes anywhere in the signal flow or
for connecting to your guitar amp via 4-Cable Method - see page 7.

IR IRs (Impulse Responses) are mathematical functions representing the

sonic measurements of audio systems. HX Stomp can store up to 128
custom or third-party IRs at a time.* See "Impulse Response (IR)"

*NOTE: To import IRs into your HX Stomp hardware, you'll need to download
and install the latest Line 6 HX Edit application. The free HX Edit app is not only
an indispensable librarian for managing and backing up all your presets and IRs,
but also provides a full-size display for easy editing, right on your Mac or Windows® computer! Visit line6.com/software to get it now.

"Wheee! I love reading manuals!"
That sounds a bit sarcastic, but regardless, thank you for buying the Line 6® HX
Stomp™ pedal, one of the most powerful and flexible stompboxes ever created. We
hope it helps drive your search for tonal bliss and spawns years of creativity, both on
stage and in the studio.

Updating HX Stomp to the Latest Firmware

Although you’re likely anxious to rip open the plastic and plug in, wait! At the very
least, check out the HX Stomp Cheat Sheet that came in the box, and keep it handy.
Then read the "Quick Start" chapter of this manual and we’ll have you up and shredding in no time.

Line 6 is continually improving HX family products. Updating the HX Stomp pedal will
ensure you always have the latest models, features, and factory presets.

1. Download and install the latest version of Line 6 Updater from
line6.com/software. (If using a Windows computer, you'll also need to
download and install the HX Stomp USB Driver for Windows.)

IMPORTANT! Because the HX Stomp pedal can be used in so many ways, its
factory presets are sort of all over the map. For example, any presets starting
with "FX" denote tones designed with effects only, for going straight into your
guitar amp. Any presets starting with "DIR" denote tones with amp, cab/IR, and
effects blocks for going direct into a full-range amplification system like FRFR
(Full Range Flat Response) or PA speakers. Also note that presets starting with
"4CM" won't sound at all unless your HX Stomp pedal is connected to your
amp via 4-Cable Method - see page 7.

2. Connect HX Stomp to your computer via the supplied USB
cable and turn it on.
3. Launch Line 6 Updater, log into your Line 6 account, and follow the prompts.

Quick Start

HX Stomp in 4-Cable Method
"4 Cable-Method" is a popular and flexible way of hooking things up, allowing you
to route some effects blocks (most often drives, distortions, wahs, and compressors)
before your amp's preamp and other effects blocks (often time-based effects like
delays and reverbs) in its effects loop.

Hooking It All Up

NOTE: The effects loops on most amplifiers run at instrument level. If your amp's
effects loop happens to run at line level, you should set the inputs and outputs of
HX Stomp to line level as well. See "Setting Proper Levels".

There are many ways to connect HX Stomp to other gear, and the following pages
illustrate only a few.

IMPORTANT! Make sure you add a Send/Return > Mono > FX Loop block at
the point in your signal flow where you wish your amp's preamp to be, otherwise you won't hear anything.

HX Stomp on a Pedalboard
Although HX Stomp has amp and cab modeling, there's no reason you have to use it,
especially if you have a favorite guitar or bass amp. All six processing blocks can be
dedicated to effects and effects control.

TIP: Look for factory presets starting with "4CM." Note that these presets will
not pass any audio unless hooked up in the method below!

TIP: Look for factory presets with names starting with "FX." These have been
created with effects blocks only.

HX Stomp with Powered Speakers

HX Stomp in a Hybrid Amp/Direct Setup

Depending on how complex your tones are, HX Stomp may be able to act as your
entire processing rig, providing amp modeling, cab modeling or cab IRs (Impulse Responses), effects, looping, and even a tuner.

When playing live, some guitarists and bassists love running their signal direct to the
FOH (Front of House) console but prefer the feel of standing in front of a real amp. HX
Stomp can accommodate both playback systems simultaneously.

When connecting HX Stomp to a powered speaker (or two powered speakers in
stereo), set the main outputs to line level. See "Setting Proper Levels".

Place a Send/Return > Mono > Send L block directly before any Amp or Amp+Cab
block in your signal flow. This will be the point where the signal is tapped and sent
to your real amp. Then the full signal flow with Amp and Cab/IR blocks can be sent to
the FOH console.

With a Y cable, you can connect up to two expression pedals and/or momentary type
footswitches to HX Stomp's rear panel EXP 1/2 | FS 4/5 jack. Alternatively, you can
connect a single Mission SP1-L6H Line 6 Expression Pedal, which has a toe switch
built in that can toggle its function between EXP 1 (Wah by default) and EXP 2 (Volume
by default).

TIP: Look for factory presets starting with "BAS." These have been created
with a Send/Return > Mono > Send L block positioned after Effects blocks and
before the Amp or Amp+Cab block. Although they've been designed with bass
players in mind, there's nothing wrong with swapping out the bass amp and cab
for a guitar amp and cab (or IR).

TIP: Look for factory presets starting with "DIR" (short for direct). These have
been created with a full tone's worth of amps, cabs, and effects.

HX Stomp as DSP Expansion

HX Stomp in the Studio

Let's face it—there are a lot of great digital guitar products out there and maybe you
just can't part with your favorite box. But maybe you're also a bit curious about HX
amp modeling and effects. Decisions, decisions.

HX Stomp also includes a multichannel USB audio/MIDI interface for your production
studio, with professional-quality A/D/A conversion, 123dB of dynamic range, and a
programmable impedance circuit. This makes it the perfect front end for the Helix
Native plug-in.

Fortunately, you can have both. If you place HX Stomp in the stereo effects loop of
your favorite modeler or profiler, it's like instantly adding 77 amps and 200 effects to
your existing arsenal. Plus, the six processing blocks in HX Stomp are utilized in addition to your modeler's DSP, so you get more simultaneous amps and effects. You may
even be able to synchronize presets and tempi between the two with a single MIDI
cable; see your modeler's documentation for more information.

R OUTPUT

If you aren't using Helix Native, HX Stomp can re-amp, or use USB audio streams
to process tracks or busses in your DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) after they're recorded. See "USB Audio" for more information.

Press the Lower Knob (or PAGE ) to view a category or subcategory’s contents.

NOTE: There are two types of All Bypass in HX Stomp: Analog bypass
(sometimes called "true bypass"), where mechanically switching relays route
your signal directly from the inputs to the outputs with no processing or
A/D/A conversion, and DSP bypass, where any delay echoes and reverb
tails decay naturally. By default, HX Stomp is set for Analog bypass, but this
behavior can be set from "Global Settings > Preferences".

Saving/Naming a Preset

For more sophisticated tones, a parallel (two stereo paths) signal flow can be created.  
This lets one split the signal into two stereo paths, process them separately, and mix
the two paths back together.

If a reverb follows a delay on a serial path, the delay's echoes will have reverb
applied. Likewise, if a delay follows a reverb on a serial path, the reverb's
tail will have distinct echoes. Conversely, if a reverb and delay are on separate parallel paths, they won't affect one another and can sometimes result in
cleaner, more defined notes

If your effect blocks don't have Mix or Blend controls, adding them to a parallel
path allows the dry guitar or bass signal to pass through unaffected and be
blended with the effected signal. This can be especially effective when blending clean and distorted bass signals

Instead of a single Amp+Cab block, you may be able to run a standalone Amp
block into two parallel Cab blocks or Impulse Responses (or one of each)

With stereo rigs, by using the Mixer block, each path can be panned freely
between the left and right speakers or amps. Different delay and/or reverb
models panned hard left and hard right can sound particularly huge
TIP: Remember that with parallel routing, both paths A and B are stereo paths,
allowing you to utilize either mono or stereo processing blocks on each, and pan
as desired. Also see "Block Order and Stereo Imaging" on page 17.

3. Press Knob 3 (Save).

In the preceding illustration:

Serial vs. Parallel Routing

Our guitar signal goes into the purple Pitch block and then the red Amp+Cab
block. The signal is split to path A (upper) and path B (lower).

For many guitar tones, a serial (a single, stereo path) signal flow is more than adequate.
For example, the preset below has a Pitch/Synth block (violet) into an Amp+Cab block
(red) into a Delay block (green) into a Reverb block (dark orange):

Stereo path A (upper) is sent to the dark orange Reverb block and stereo path B
(lower) is sent to the green Delay block.
Stereo paths A and B are merged together and sent to the Output.

3. Press ACTION again to drop the Delay block.
To remove path B, return all blocks that reside on path B (lower) to path A (upper).

Setting Path B's Output

SHORTCUT: From Stomp or Scroll mode, touch FS3 (TAP/TUNER) to briefly
display Tempo parameters.

There may be situations where you want parallel path B to be sent to a completely

Tips to Optimize DSP
•

•

Some guitarists feel that tuning certain strings
slightly sharp or flat in relation to concert tuning can
improve intonation. String offsets calibrate the tuner
so that these slightly out-of-tune pitches appear
as in tune. String 6 is low E and String 1 is high
E. Tuning offsets won't be applied unless Knob 3
(Offsets) on Page 1 is turned on.

Dynamic DSP

•
•

Like nearly all modern audio processors, the HX Stomp engine is based on DSP (Digital Signal Processing). Some models require many times more DSP horsepower than
others, so it makes logical sense that fewer of those models could exist in a tone. To
work around this, some processors restrict you to one amp, one reverb, one delay,
etc. With HX Stomp, who are we to say you can't run six distortions in a row? Or two
Amp blocks into two IRs? Or two parallel mods into two parallel delays into two parallel reverbs for some massive swirly stereo ambient wash? We feel it's important to let
you keep adding whatever you want to your tone, even if you may eventually run out
of DSP.

16

Some block types use much more DSP than others, such as amps, cabs, IRs,
and pitch shifters. Not surprisingly, the Amp+Cab block uses the most. EQ,
Dynamics, Volume/Pan, and Send/Return blocks use relatively little
Some models may use more DSP than others in the same category. This is
especially true with amp models

Instead of a parallel path with two Amp+Cab blocks or two separate Amps
and Cabs, try adding a single Amp block followed by a single Cab > Dual block
(mixing two different Cabs can provide some substantial variations)

The stereo version of an effects block will use roughly twice as much DSP as
a mono version of the same block. Likewise, the dual version of a cab block
will use roughly twice as much DSP as the single version
Some model categories have “Simple” blocks, which utilize less DSP than
others
Effects models in the Legacy subcategory generally—but not always—use
less DSP than those in the Mono and Stereo subcategories

Instead of toggling between two of the same amp or effects blocks (with different settings), use controllers or snapshots to instantly adjust parameters
within a single block. You'd be surprised at how wildly different tones you can
get from simply adjusting an amp model's tonestack knobs

Block Order and Stereo Imaging
The signal path in HX Stomp is stereo, carrying two channels of audio. When the
device is fed a stereo input source (i.e., when discrete left and right signals are connected into the HX Stomp Left and Right input jacks), the source audio is processed
discretely in stereo wherever stereo blocks are used within the path. Whenever a mono
block is added within a path, both channels of audio are combined and sent out of the
block as mono.
Most of the effects models in HX Stomp have both mono and stereo versions. A stereo
block displays
after its model name in the inspector. The stereo imaging—or how
wide your tone appears with stereo speakers or headphones—is highly dependent on
the type of blocks you add and in what order.
Legacy effects models vary in behavior, just as on the classic Line 6 effects from where
these models originated.
•
•

•

Legacy Distortion, Dynamics & Pitch/Synth effects are mono

Legacy Modulation & Delay effects vary in that some are mono, some stereo,
and some mono in/stereo out, where adjusting the effect's Mix parameter
can narrow the stereo image that is fed into them. It's best to experiment
with these effects and tweak the Mix parameter to achieve the desired stereo
output results
Legacy Filter and Reverb effects are stereo

TIP: Even if you’re running a single amp or other mono playback system, sometimes stereo effects can still sound “fuller” than their mono counterparts. This is
especially true with stereo reverbs.

The Blocks

Input Settings
Page Knob Parameter

Input

1

The Input block has a dedicated noise gate. Threshold and Decay parameters are
grayed out unless Knob 1 (Gate) is turned on.
The vast majority of the time, you'll want the Input block to be fed from the Main L/
MONO and RIGHT inputs. However, you can instead feed the Return L/MONO and
RIGHT inputs into the signal flow or even USB In 5/6 for re-amping purposes.

2

From Edit view, turn the Upper Knob to select the Input block and
then turn the Lower Knob to change the input.

INPUT MAIN L/R

INPUT RETURN L/R

Description

1

Gate

2

Sets the input level at which the noise gate acts on
Thresh[old] the signal. If your guitar gets cut off abruptly, turn the
Threshold up.

3

Decay

Determines how abruptly the noise gate is applied
once the signal drops below the threshold level.

In-Z

HX Stomp has an impedance circuit on its Main L/R
inputs that affects tone and feel by loading your
guitar's pickups as they would by an effect pedal or
amplifier. A lower value will typically result in some
high frequency attenuation, lower gain, and an overall
"softer" feel. A higher value provides full frequency
response, higher gain, and an overall "tighter" feel.

1

INPUT USB 5/6

Turns the Input noise gate on and off.

Outputs
Most presets have one Output Main L/R block, which is used to adjust its overall level
and balance between stereo speakers. When a parallel path configuration exists, if
you route the Mixer block to path B, a second Output block appears for routing path B
signals from the stereo Send output. See "Setting Path B's Output".

Main L/R Both the L/MONO and RIGHT inputs are active simultaneously. Normally, you should choose Input Main L/R.

OUTPUT MAIN L/R

Return Return L/MONO and RIGHT can act as a stereo Input block for proL/R cessing keyboards, a drum machine, or even another modeler. If a

OUTPUT MAIN L/R+SEND L/R

Return or FX Loop processing block exists in the preset, the utilized
Return input will be non-selectable. See "Send/Return".

USB 5/6 USB inputs 5/6 can be used for processing tracks from your Mac or
Windows DAW software. See "USB Audio".

Output Settings

NOTE: HX Stomp also receives input from USB 1/2 and 3/4, but they're dedicated for monitoring audio from your computer (or iPad device) and bypass all processing blocks. As such, USB 1/2 or 3/4 are not available as input block sources.

Choosing a ms value provides a specific time in milliseconds; choosing a Note Division value provides a time based on the current tempo.
With a note division value, this parameter’s value is retained when
changing models.

Scale

Delay models with multiple taps have a Scale parameter for each tap,
which adjusts its time relative to the main Time value. For example,
if the Time parameter is set to 500ms, setting T1 Scale to "50%" will
mean that tap will be at 250ms. If you then adjust the Time parameter,
the timing of all the taps will scale accordingly.

Depth

Adjusts the intensity of the modulation. Higher settings result in more
extreme pitch bending, wobble, or throb, depending on the effect.

Feedbk

Adjusts the amount of delayed signal fed back into the effect. Higher

Spread differs slightly among stereo delay effects. For most delays,
it adjusts how widely the repeats bounce left and right. With the Ping
Pong Delay, for example, 0 is in the middle (mono), and 10 is full left to
right panning for the repeats.
For modulated stereo delays, Spread affects the LFOs' (low frequency
oscillators) stereo modulation behavior. At 0 the LFOs are in sync. At
10, the two LFOs are 180 degrees out of sync, so that when one side
is modulating up, the other side is modulating down.
Some mod and delay pedals' internal signal paths exhibit a bit of grit,
especially when placed after a high-gain distortion block. Negative
values increase the perceived amount of grit; positive values clean
things up a bit. At 0dB, the model behaves like the original pedal.
Filters a portion of the block's bass and/or treble frequencies, which
can help remove rumble and/or high-end harshness.

Mix

Blends the effected "wet" signal vs. the "dry" signal passed through
the block. When set to 0%, the path bypasses the effect completely.
When set to 100%, the entire path is fed through the effect, and no
dry thru signal is heard.

Level

Adjusts the overall output level of the effects block. Be careful not to
boost this parameter too high on multiple blocks, as digital clipping
could occur. You should typically leave this at 0.0dB for most blocks.
Where the original pedal's level or volume knob behavior doesn't
really apply to dB values, 0.0-10 may be used.

Trails

Trails Off: Any delay repeats or reverb decays are instantly muted
when the block is bypassed. Trails On: Any delay repeats or reverb
decays continue to decay naturally when the block is bypassed or a
different snapshot is selected.

Amp+Cab

Amp Models

Amp+Cab blocks are convenient in that when you select an Amp model, its matching Cab model is automatically loaded. It also only uses up one of the six available
processing blocks.

To change the amp model in an Amp+Cab block, press PAGE until the amp icon is bright red and turn the Lower Knob. To change
the cab model, press PAGE until the cab icon is bright red and

Common Amp Settings
Parameter

Description

Master

Adjusts the amount of overall amp output level, as well as power amp
distortion. This parameter is highly interactive with all other power
amp parameters—the lower the Master is set, the less effect the other
controls will have.

Sag

Lower Sag values offer a "tighter" responsiveness for faster metal
performances; higher values provide more touch dynamics & sustain
for blues and classic rock riffs.

Hum
Ripple

Controls how much heater hum and AC ripple interacts with your tone.
At higher settings, things get freaky.

Bias

Changes the bias of the power tubes. Lower values achieve a "colder"
Class AB biasing. At maximum, the amp is operating in Class A.

Bias X

Determines how the power amp tubes' voicing reacts when pushed
hard. Set low for a tighter feel. Set high for more tube compression.
This parameter is highly reactive with the Drive and Master settings.

Amp

®

Amp blocks are identical to Amp+Cab blocks, except they contain no matched cab
model.

®

Preamp
We’ve also included a complete set of Preamp versions of each Amp model, which
provide the tone of just the preamp stage of the amp—recommended when feeding
the HX Stomp pedal into the power amp section of your favorite amplifier. You'll also
find a studio microphone preamp within the Preamp > Mic category.

Preamp blocks require less DSP than a full Amp block.

Cab

Cab Models

There are two subcategories of Cab blocks—Single and Dual. Dual cabs have a stereo
output, with each cab panned hard left and right. Not surprisingly, dual cabs take twice
as much DSP as single cabs.

To change the first cab model in a Cab > Dual block, press <PAGE
until the left cab icon is bright red and turn the Lower Knob. To
change the second cab, press PAGE> until the right cab icon is
bright red and turn the Lower Knob.

Impulse Responses are mathematical functions representing the sonic measurements
of specific audio systems (for HX Stomp, acoustic guitar body resonance or speaker cabinet and microphone combinations). HX Stomp can load and store up to 128
custom or third-party IRs at a time.

Loading Custom IRs

Loading custom impulse responses requires connecting to the HX Edit software in
your Mac or Windows computer. The HX Edit application is available as a free download from line6.com/software.

3. Drag one or more IR files from the desktop or any Finder window directly into the HX Edit app's Impulses list.

HX Edit updates the HX Stomp hardware's IR list automatically. HX Stomp can
load and store up to 128 IRs at a time. 48kHz, 16-bit, mono, .WAV type IRs of
up to 2,048 samples are natively supported; however, HX Edit lets you import IR
.WAV files of different sample rate, bit depth, length and stereo format, and the
app will convert these attributes automatically before sending to HX Stomp.

Go to the HX Edit app's Preferences to set the preferred behavior for importing Stereo WAV IRs - there you can choose to import the left or right channel
data of the file, or a mix of both channels for the (mono) IR.

The imported IR is automatically shortened (or lengthened) to 2,048 samples.
You may optionally choose a 1,024-sample version from the model list to
save DSP, which fades out the IR halfway through.
IMPORTANT! IR blocks reference an IR index number, not the actual IR
file. For example, if you happen to replace or clear "IR 12" from the HX
Edit application, it will affect any presets containing IR blocks with "IR 12"
selected.

Snapshots

Each of the three snapshots in HX Stomp stores and recalls the state of certain elements in the current preset, including:
•

In Play view, a small camera icon appears in the upper right corner of the screen. Its
number indicates the current snapshot.

•

1

•

Effect Bypass—The bypass (on/off) state of all processing blocks (The bypass
state of the 1 Switch Looper is not stored/recalled via snapshot)
Parameter Control—The values of any parameters assigned to controllers
(up to 64 per preset)

Tempo—The current system tempo, if "Global Settings > MIDI/Tempo" >
Tempo Select is set to "Per Snapshot." (By default, it's set to "Per Preset")

Depending on how you configure them, snapshots can act as three variations of the
same tone, three drastically different tones, or any combination thereof—all within the
same preset. In many cases, a single preset's snapshots may accommodate all the
various tones required for a song.

What are Snapshots?
Imagine you have eight pet octopuses, all slithering around your amp and pedalboard.
Instead of tap-dancing on your pedals (and accidentally stepping on a tentacle), you
shout "Okay, gang—here's the verse... now!" and your octopuses switch some pedals
on, switch other pedals off, and tweak all your amps and pedals' knobs to make the
best possible settings for your song's verse, all seamlessly with spillover delay and
reverb trails. Then you shout "Ready for the chorus... now!" and your octopuses instantly tweak everything for your song's chorus. That's the power of snapshots.

Using Snapshots
1. From Play view, press PAGE
switch mode:

1

until you see Snapshot foot-

2. Press one of the three snapshot switches to select a different
snapshot.
3. Adjust the preset by doing one or more of the following:

The only thing your octopuses/snapshots can't do is rearrange your pedalboard or
swap out an effect or amp for a different one (unless both effect or amp blocks exist
in the same preset).

•

Turn one or more effects on or off by pressing stomp mode footswitches or pressing the Upper Knob in "Edit View". Snapshots remember every
block's on/off state.

•

To adjust a parameter AND have it automatically update per snapshot,
press and turn the knob. Snapshots remember the values of up to 64 effects
parameters. The parameter's value appears white, indicating a controller's assigned to it—in this case, the Snapshots controller:

Harmony Delay

Each preset can have up to 64 parameters assigned to Snapshots; hence, eight octopuses with eight tentacles each. The octopuses can remember three separate groups
of on/off statuses and setting tweaks per preset (say, for your verse, chorus, and overindulgent noise segue); that is, HX Stomp has three snapshots per preset.

Saving a preset stores all of its 3 snapshots automatically.

NOTE: You can also manually assign the Snapshots controller. From the
"Controller Assign" page, select the desired block and parameter and
turn Knob 2 (Controller) to select "Snapshot."

NOTE: Selecting a preset recalls the snapshot that was active when the preset
was saved.

4. Switch back to the snapshot you started with.

HX Stomp instantly and seamlessly returns to its previous state.

Determining Snapshot Edit Behavior

NOTE: If you've changed "Global Settings > Preferences" > Snapshot Edits
to "Discard," you must save the preset before selecting a different snapshot;
otherwise any edits will be discarded!

Say you’re on Snapshot 1 (verse) and you change a few things—switch a delay block
on, switch a mod block off, tweak a distortion’s Drive parameter, etc. If you switch to
Snapshot 2 (chorus) and then back to Snapshot 1 for the second verse, should HX
Stomp recall those changes or return Snapshot 1 to its state when the preset was last
saved? There’s no right answer, therefore, HX Stomp lets you choose.

Copying/Pasting a Snapshot

1. Press

Instead of creating a new snapshot from scratch, you may want to copy an existing
one to another snapshot location and tweak just a few things.

Tips for Creative Snapshot Use
•

•
•

•
•
•

The obvious use case for snapshots is designating them to specific sections
of your song. For example, Snapshot 1 could be the Intro, Snapshot 2 might
be Verse 1, Snapshot 3 might be the Chorus, and so on.

Turn any Delay, Reverb, and/or FX Loops blocks' Trails parameter to "On" for
seamless spillover between snapshots.

Worried that further tweaking might make your tone worse, not better? Snapshots are a great way to compare minor changes between tones without
having to take your hands off the guitar.
Set different keys in Harmony Delay blocks or intervals in Pitch blocks per snapshot.

Having difficulty maintaining consistent volume throughout a song? Set one of
the effects' Gain or Level parameter per snapshot.
You can alternatively change snapshots via MIDI. See "MIDI CC" on page 49.

(or FS3 if Global Settings > Footswitches > FS3 Function is set
to "Stomp 3") until the following dialog appears:

Switch

Type

Input, Output and Mixer blocks cannot be assigned. Split blocks can be assigned;
when bypassed, the Split Y and Split A/B type blocks revert to an even signal split
to each path, and the Split Crossover type applies no frequency split, with the
signal fed to each path evenly.

Merge

4. Turn Knob 1 (Switch) to select the desired footswitch or expression pedal.

OK

None Removes the bypass assignment.

If you want to replace any other blocks that may already be assigned to the footswitch, turn Knob 2 (Assign) to "Replace." Otherwise, leave it set to "Merge,"
which allows for multiple blocks to be assigned to the same switch.

FS1-FS5 Stepping on the Stomp mode footswitch turns the block on and off.
Note that FS3, FS4 or FS5 won't function unless Global Settings > Footswitches > FS3 [FS4, FS5] Function is set to "Stomp 3 [Stomp 4, Stomp
5]."

3. Press Knob 3 (OK).

Selecting a footswitch displays Knob 2 (Type). Turn Knob 2 to select
"Moment[ary]" or "Latching" behavior. When set to Momentary, the
block is bypassed (or enabled, if already bypassed) for as long as you
hold the switch. When set to Latching, the block is bypassed (or enabled, if already bypassed) every time you press the switch.
EXP 1, EXP 2 Moving the expression pedal automatically enables (or bypasses) the
block.
Selecting EXP 1 or 2 displays Knob 2 (Position) and Knob 3 (Wait). Position determines where in the expression pedal's travel the block is
enabled or bypassed. 0% is heel down; 99% is toe down. Wait determines how long HX Stomp waits before bypassing the block; for example, you wouldn't want the wah to turn off every time you touched
the heel down position in your big funk wah solo.

35

Swapping Stomp Footswitches

SHORTCUT: Alternatively, press PAGE , press Knob 3 (Learn) and then
either move the desired expression pedal or send the desired MIDI CC message from your MIDI controller. HX Stomp automatically selects it.

If you want to change the location of Stomp mode footswitches (especially those with
multiple items assigned), instead of manually reassigning everything, you can quickly
swap all assignments between two stomp footswitches.

TIP: By default, bypass toggling for the block via EXP 1 or EXP 2 is configured for "heel down = off" behavior. To reverse bypass behavior, press
the Upper Knob (bypass). In such case, the block will be bypassed when
moving the expression pedal past the configured Position location. Since
it is possible to configure the bypass of multiple blocks to be assigned to
an expression pedal, you can set each block's Position value differently thereby allowing the pedal to turn some blocks on and others off at different
positions in the pedal's travel.

1. Touch (but don't press) any two Stomp footswitches until the
following dialog appears:

Swap FS1 and FS2?

5. If desired, press PAGE and turn Knob 1 (MIDI In) to assign an
incoming MIDI CC message to turn the block on and off.

Cancel

2. Press Knob 3 (OK).

Incoming CC values 0-63 turn the block off; values 64-127 turn the block on. Note
that some MIDI CCs are reserved for global functions and cannot be selected see "MIDI CC".

If you find yourself constantly toggling one switch off and another on, assign  
both blocks to the same footswitch, and while one is selected, press the
Upper Knob. Now pressing the footswitch will toggle one off and the other on  
simultaneously.

Assign a Wah block to be engaged only when moving an expression pedal
past 1%. Set the Wait time long enough so that natural foot movements don't
turn the wah off every time you reach the heel-down position, but no so long  
that it turns off noticeably late when you rest the expression pedal at heeldown - See "Manual Bypass Assign".
Different blocks can be enabled or bypassed at different locations of an expression pedal's travel. Experiment with turning on multiple overdrive blocks—one
at Position 5%, another at Position 30%, another at Position 70%, and so on.

When using a footswitch to toggle between two Amp or Amp+Cab blocks,
the amp models may sound notably different from one another (just like real  
amps!). Use an EQ block to make one Amp block sound a bit closer to the
other Amp block and assign its bypass to the same footswitch.
Assign a delay block with very high feedback to be turned on only when reaching the toe position of an expression pedal. Squeals galore.

Controller Assign

NOTE: To manually access the Controller Assign menu, press
Knob 2 (Controller Assign).

2. Press PAGE

HX Stomp provides a wide variety of tools for controlling your tone during a performance. The most obvious controller would be a connected expression pedal (often
assigned to Wah, Pitch Wham or Volume), but you may also assign footswitches to
toggle between two values of a given parameter or parameters, or even have parameters instantly change when selecting different snapshots within a preset.

EXP 1 or 2 Expression pedals are the most common type of controller, used
to control volume, wah, Pitch Wham, etc.

IMPORTANT! Adding a Wah or Pitch Wham block automatically assigns it to be
controlled by EXP 1. Adding a Volume or Pan block automatically assigns it to
be controlled by EXP 2. With a Mission SP1-L6H Line 6 Expression Pedal, connecting it to HX Stomp with a Y-cable will just work, and its built-in toe switch
will toggle between any Wah/Pitch Wham and Volume/Pan blocks. Also see
page 42.

FS1-FS5 Stepping on a Stomp mode footswitch can toggle between a parameter's min and max values.
Selecting FS1-FS5 will display Knob 3 (Switch Type). Turn Knob
3 to select "Moment[ary]" or "Latch[ing]" behavior. Momentary
means the value will change for as long as you hold the switch.
Latching toggles between Min and Max values every time you press
the switch.*

Assigning a Controller

MIDI CC Selecting "MIDI CC" will display Knob 3 (CC#). Turn Knob 3 to

By default, a parameter's Min and Max values will be pretty extreme. It pays to
play pretty conservative here, as subtle parameter adjustments go a long way.

To smoothly blend between the tone on parallel paths A and B, select a Split
> A/B block and assign the Route To parameter to an expression pedal. By
default, a heel-down position means the signal passes fully through Path A.
Moving the pedal toward the toe-down position will gradually crossfade into
Path B. Alternatively, assign a footswitch to control the Route To parameter, for
instantly switching back and forth.
If you're looking for an ultra-clean boost, instead of adding a Volume/Pan >
Gain block, try assigning a footswitch to increase the Level parameter of a
Mixer or Output block.
If you have a favorite delay or reverb pedal, use an FX Loop block to insert it
into your tone. Assign EXP 1 or 2 to control the block's Mix parameter, which
will smoothly blend the pedal into your tone.

For extreme psychedelic dub delay squeals, assign a footswitch to both increase a Delay's feedback and decrease its time.
Assign a footswitch to toggle between two Delay > Time parameter values,
such as 1/4 and 1/8 dotted.
Assign IR Select to a footswitch. Set the two IRs as min and max values. Now
you can instantly toggle between them.

Bypass Type

When pressing the Upper and Lower knobs together (or a footswitch assigned to "All Bypass"), HX Stomp bypasses all blocks. There are two types
of All Bypass in HX Stomp—Choose "Analog" if you want to your guitar's signal routed directly from the HX Stomp inputs to its outputs, with no processing or A/D/A conversion (also called "true bypass"). Choose "DSP" if you want delay echoes and reverb tails to decay naturally when HX Stomp
is bypassed.

Snapsht Edits

Determines whether or not any edits made to a snapshot (block on/off, parameter control, tempo) are remembered when returning to that snapshot. When set to "Recall," any snapshot edits are recalled when jumping from snapshot to snapshot, and appear as you last left them. When set
to "Discard," any snapshot edits are discarded when jumping from snapshot to snapshot, and appear as the preset was last saved. If you want
to save changes made to a snapshot while Snapshot Edits is set to "Discard,” press SAVE twice before selecting another. Also see "Determining
Snapshot Edit Behavior".

HX Stomp functions as a USB 2.0, multichannel, 24-bit/96kHz, low-latency audio interface for Windows and Mac computers, as well as for iPad and iPhone mobile devices (with optional Apple Camera Connection Kit adapter), and is compatible with all
major DAW software. Refer to the illustration and tables below for a description of how
audio is handled between HX Stomp and your computer.
NOTE:  For USB audio operation on Windows computers, you must first download and install the Line 6 HX Stomp ASIO driver (see page 46). For Mac computers, it is only necessary to download and install the latest Line 6 Helix Mac
Core Audio driver if you desire audio sample rate operation at rates other than
48kHz (see page 46). These drivers are available from line6.com/software.
There is no driver installation necessary for Apple iPad or iPhone mobile devices.

Hardware Monitoring vs. DAW Software
Monitoring

INPUT

RIGHT

HX Stomp provides hardware monitoring, which lets you hear your live input signal at all
times, independent of your DAW software's monitor settings. Hardware monitoring can
be desirable since it allows you to hear your live guitar with HX processing added and essentially "latency-free," since the monitor signal is not routed through your DAW software.

In some DAW recording scenarios, it may be preferable to utilize your recording application's "input monitoring" or "software monitoring" feature, which routes your live
input signal through the armed recording track, thus allowing you to monitor the input
effected by any plug-ins you may have inserted on the track. The one downside of
DAW software monitoring, however, is that your live input signal will be delayed slightly
due to being routed through the software and back to HX Stomp's outputs, which is
referred to as "latency." HX Stomp is designed to provide very low latency operation—
see "ASIO Driver Settings (Windows only)" for info and settings.

When a DAW track's software monitoring is active, you'll likely not want to simultaneously hear the HX Stomp hardware monitoring signal. To achieve this, it is best to use
the HX Stomp USB 5/6 inputs as your DAW audio track’s input source, and to select
the Main L/R Output block on HX Stomp and turn its Level all the way down. This
configuration allows you to hear and record only the dry, DI signal from HX Stomp into
your audio track. (See the next section for more on recording a DI track.)

DI Recording and Re-amping

NOTE: Setting the stereo track's output to Helix USB 1/2 allows you to hear
your processed tone via HX Stomp's hardware monitoring while recording.
For this configuration, disable software input monitoring on all DAW tracks.

A common DAW recording technique is to record a dry DI (Direct Input) signal, such as
the unprocessed signal from your guitar. This lets you process the DI track later with
plug-ins (such as the Helix Native plug-in), and/or "re-amp" the DI track through an
amp or other outboard gear. HX Stomp has handy options built right in for recording
DI tracks, as well as for easy re-amplification of DI tracks back through your own HX
Stomp tones, all without extra hardware or cabling!

3. Arm both these DAW audio tracks, hit the Record button and
start laying down your guitar performance!
Now you have your processed track to hear with the project, and a separate DI track
with which you can further experiment at any time with DAW plug-ins and/or re-amping (see the next section).

HX Stomp offers two special DI outputs—USB Outs 5 and 6, which are fed directly
from the Main L/MONO and RIGHT inputs. Also note that USB Outs 7 and 8 are fed
directly (unprocessed) from the Return/Aux In L/MONO and RIGHT inputs for simultaneously tracking a stereo digital piano, synth, drum machine, or other device.

Re-amping Through HX Stomp
Now let's take the dry DI guitar track we recorded and route it back through HX Stomp
for processing.

Recording a Dry DI Track
For this example, we'll record guitar into two DAW tracks simultaneously, with one
capturing the processed tone and the other the unprocessed DI guitar.

1. From Play view, turn the Upper Knob to select the Input block
and then turn the Lower Knob to choose "Input USB 5/6."
You'll see that a small USB icon has replaced the Input block:

1. Create two new audio tracks in your DAW software project:

INPUT MAIN L/R

Create one mono track to record the dry DI guitar, and set the track's input
to HX Stomp USB 5.

INPUT USB 5/6

Create one stereo track to record your full, stereo, processed tone and set
the track's input to HX Stomp USB 1/2.

2. Set both tracks' outputs, as well as the DAW Master output to
HX Stomp USB 1/2 to allow all tracks to play back through HX
Stomp.

2. In your DAW software, set the DI track's Output setting to HX
Stomp USB 5/6.

ASIO Driver Settings (Windows only)

3. Create a new stereo track in your DAW project and set both its
Input and Output to USB 1/2. Arm the track for recording.

When using HX Stomp as an audio interface for Windows DAW applications, it is
highly recommended to configure the software to utilize the HX Stomp "ASIO" driver.
The Line 6 HX Stomp ASIO driver offers the superior, low-latency audio performance
required for DAW recording. This driver selection is typically found in your DAW software's Preferences or Options dialog - see your software's documentation.

NOTE: In some DAW software it may be necessary to also activate the software monitoring feature on this "re-amped" track to monitor the processed
signal when playing back your project. See your software's documentation.

4. Now play your DAW project and you'll hear the DI track "reamped" through HX Stomp! Tweak your amp & effects blocks
as desired while listening with the playback of your project
mix.

NOTE: Download and install the latest Line 6 HX Stomp ASIO driver from
line6.com/software.
Once the HX Stomp ASIO driver has been selected in your DAW software, you'll also
see a button in the same dialog for "ASIO Settings" (or with a similar title). Press this
button to launch the HX Stomp Control Panel, where you make the following driver
settings.

5. Once you have your re-amplified guitar tone they way you like
it, Solo both the DI and re-amped tracks, rewind to the start of
the project and hit the DAW Record button, allowing it to capture the signal into the new re-amped track in real-time.
Allow the DI track to play to the end, stop recording and you've created your new reamped guitar track!
TIP: Note that you still have your original Guitar DI track, and you can repeat this
process to create additional re-amped tracks with different HX Stomp settings,
add plug-ins, blend with your original guitar track, and more.

Re-amping is powerful but really slow. Isn't there an
easier way?
Absolutely! Instead of routing your dry DI guitar tracks through HX Stomp and then
re-tracking everything in real time (something that can take forever if you have a long
song with many guitar and bass tracks to re-amp), you can simply insert the Helix
Native plug-in on each track. Helix Native lets you apply the DSP horsepower of HX
Stomp to any of your production's tracks (including vocals, keyboards, synths, drums,
busses or more), without having to deal with routing or re-amping.
Sound This button launches the Windows Sound Control Panel, which is
Control where you can optionally configure HX Stomp to be the audio playPanel back device for multi-media applications (such as Windows Media
Player, iTunes, etc.) The settings within the Windows Sound Control Panel are not relevant for your DAW software, since standard
multi-media applications utilize the standard Windows driver.

Core Audio Driver Settings (macOS only)
To use HX Stomp as an audio interface for Mac applications, it is not necessary to install any additional driver. HX Stomp will utilize the Mac computer's "Class Compliant"
USB driver automatically simply by connecting to your USB port. HX Stomp will then
appear as a selectable Core Audio device within the Mac Utilities > Audio MIDI Setup
panel and/or directly within your DAW host and multimedia applications. However,
note that this Apple Class Compliant driver offers strictly 48kHz native sample rate operation. If you prefer to use a different native sample rate (or if your particular DAW application requires it), you can optionally download and install the Line 6 Helix Mac Core
Audio driver from line6.com/software. This Line 6 driver supports HX Stomp, as well as
all Helix devices, and offers 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88kHz or 96kHz sample rate operation.

Default Bit Select the Bit Depth at which HX Stomp will operate for recording
Depth and playback with your DAW software. 24 bit or 32 bit are recommended for quality audio production.

46

ASIO Your goal is to achieve the lowest latency possible in your DAW
Buffer Size software, but with glitch-free audio performance. Smaller buffer
size results in lower latency, however, also increases the demands
on your computer, which can result in clicks, pops or other audio
artifacts. Start with a lower slider setting here and, if you encounter
audio performance issues, come back to this panel and move this
slider to the right incrementally to remedy the problem.
Click the Apply and OK buttons when your HX Stomp Control Panel settings are complete to return to your DAW software. Please also refer to your DAW software's documentation for more about its own specific audio device, buffer and project settings.

In addition, certain modulation effects with have distinct rhythmic elements; for example, a tremolo set to a square wave (sometimes called a "slicer") not only has a
tempo, but a beat, where the upswing of the wave lands with relation to your song.
That is, the effect may be in perfect tempo sync with your song, but its "downbeat"
may be shifted ahead or behind of your drummer's—or in the studio, your recorded
song's—downbeat.
